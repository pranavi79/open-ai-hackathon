<h1>🚨 MediAid: Your Digital Lifeline in Critical Moments 🚨</h1>

<h2>Project Title: MediAid</h2>

<h2>The Big Idea:</h2>
Life can change in a single, unexpected moment. An accident, a sudden collapse—when every second counts, waiting for help is not an option. MediAid is an application designed to empower everyday people to become first responders, ensuring that professional medical help is dispatched quickly and efficiently to those in need.

<h2>The Problem: A Race Against Time ⏱️</h2>
In critical situations, the "golden hour"—the first 60 minutes after a traumatic injury—is crucial for survival. However, in many places, especially in India, this time is often lost due to significant delays.
* <b>Slow Response Times:</b> While some government agencies aim for a 25-30 minute response time, real-world data shows that in some cases, response times in India can be much longer. A study in Maharashtra, for example, found an average ambulance response time of 134.5 minutes for emergency cases.
* <b>A Global Challenge:</b> The problem isn't unique to India. South Korea, despite its advanced technological infrastructure, faces similar issues. A study showed that almost 44% of administrative districts in South Korea could not reach an emergency medical center within the ideal time. This highlights that this is a global challenge that requires a smart, human-centered technological solution, not just more cameras.
* <b>The Human Toll:</b> Emergency call dispatchers are the unsung heroes, but their jobs are among the most stressful. Research shows that dispatchers, who are often physically and mentally isolated from the scene, experience high rates of burnout, stress, and vicarious trauma. A study on the mental health of 911 dispatchers found that over 60% felt burned out. By automating and streamlining the initial triage, MediAid reduces this emotional burden on emergency workers, allowing them to focus on what matters most.
How it Works: Unleashing the Power of the Crowd

MediAid turns ordinary bystanders into a network of first responders.
1. Incident Reporting (via Chatbot)
A bystander can quickly report an incident using our intuitive chatbot interface. They provide details of the situation and the location.

3. Web-based Triage (for the dispatcher)
The information is sent to a dispatcher’s live webpage. The dispatcher or an automated system can then verify the situation and select the appropriate response scenario.

3. The Magic Under the Hood:
 * Our system uses the powerful Google Maps API to instantly identify the closest hospital to the incident.
 * It then checks the real-time availability of that hospital to ensure they can accept the patient.
 * Finally, based on this verified information, an ambulance is dispatched with a single click.

Our Secret Sauce: The Tech Stack

 * Frontend:
     - Flutter
 * Backend & APIs:
     - Python
     - Twillio
     - Google Maps API
     - OpenAI Agents SDK
     - GPT OSS 20b
     - FastAPI (w Uvicorn)

The Future is Now (and It's Watching)

Our ultimate goal is to integrate with a more passive and proactive system: public surveillance cameras. This would allow us to automatically detect incidents in real-time and dispatch help before a bystander even has a chance to pull out their phone.
This is our long-term vision, but for now, we're focused on perfecting our bystander-driven application to save lives, one report at a time.
